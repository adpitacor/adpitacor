Hello there, it's Adpitacor, an OIer from China. Although knowing Github a few years ago, this guy didn't have a account untill 2022.9.4, a pretty ordinary day.

### What's the meaning of your name?

Actually, it has no (meaningful) meaning.

The word "adpitac" just poped out of my head the day I was thinking of making a game. I used the word as a new kind of monetary unit because I was tired of "coin".

The mind of making the game vanished, but the word didn't. I soon found out that the word is unique, so I simply added "or" (I thought it's better than "er") after "adpitac" and make it the name of my accounts on many online platforms, such as [洛谷(Luogu)](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/374733), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/adpitacor), [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/adpitacor) and so on.

### What projects are you working on?

Saying about this, I have a few ideas and am working on them (though having little progress):

- Rewrite [wenyan](https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan) compiler to make it faster and add brand new syntax either to make simplification or to support more ES6 syntax, so that the language can be used to produce more practical and powerful Javascript code.

- Implement a Neuron Network for Machine Learning **from scratch**, understand the basic principle of it, and use it to recognize digits and alphabets. (That's pretty much like the OCR.)
