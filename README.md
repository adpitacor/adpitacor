Hello there, it's Adpitacor, an OIer from China. Although knowing Github a few years ago, this guy didn't have a account untill 2022.9.4, a pretty ordinary day.

### What's the meaning of your name?

Actually, it has no (meaningful) meaning.

One day, I was in the mood to make a game. I wanted to create a new monetary unit because I was bored with "coin". With no reason, I just came up with the word "adpitac".

The game wasn't brought out, but the word remained in my mind. I soon figured out that the word is unique, so I simply added "-or" (somehow better than "-er") after "adpitac" and used it as the name of my accounts on many online platforms, such as Github (as you see), [洛谷(Luogu)](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/374733), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/adpitacor), [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/adpitacor) and so on.

### What projects are you working on?

Saying about this, I have a few ideas and am working on them (though having little progress):

- Rewrite [wenyan](https://github.com/wenyan-lang/wenyan) compiler to make it faster and add new syntax both to make simplification and to support more ES6 syntax, so that the language can be used to produce more practical and powerful Javascript code.

- Implement a Neuron Network for Machine Learning **from scratch**, understand the basic principle of it, and use it to recognize digits and alphabets. (That's pretty much like the OCR.)
